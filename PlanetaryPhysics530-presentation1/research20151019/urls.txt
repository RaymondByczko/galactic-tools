Frost Avalanche on Mars
This scarp at the edge of the North Polar layered deposits of Mars is the site of the most frequent frost avalanches seen by
HiRISE. At this season, northern spring, frost avalanches are common and HiRISE monitors the scarp to learn more about the timing
and frequency of the avalanches, and their relationship to the evolution of frost.

Sand Dunes in Spring
Mars’ northern-most sand dunes are beginning to emerge from their winter cover of seasonal carbon dioxide (dry) ice.
Dark, bare south-facing slopes are soaking up the warmth of the sun.

North Polar Layers of Mars
The north polar layered deposits are layers of dusty ice up to 2 miles thick and approximately 620 miles in diameter.
We can see the layers exposed on the walls of troughs and scarps cut into the deposits, such as the trough wall imaged here.

A Burst of Spring
Spring has sprung on Mars, bringing with it the disappearance of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) that covers the north polar sand dunes.
In spring, the sublimation of the ice (going directly from ice to gas) causes a host of uniquely Martian phenomena.

In this image streaks of dark basaltic sand have been carried from below the ice layer to form fan-shaped deposits on top of the seasonal ice.
The similarity in the directions of the fans suggests that they formed at the same time, when the wind direction and speed was the same.
They often form along the boundary between the dune and the surface below.
